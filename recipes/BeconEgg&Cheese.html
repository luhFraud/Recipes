        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A bacon, egg and cheese sandwich is a breakfast 
            sandwich popular in the United States and Canada. It 
            is made with bacon, eggs (typically fried or scrambled), 
            cheese and bread, which may be buttered and toasted.

        </p>
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bagel (plain, whole wheat or everything)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices of bacon, cooked</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 slices of American cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Slice bagel in half and spread the butter on
                the cut sides.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Pre heat your cast iron pan (or griddle) over 
                medium heat and, once hot, toast the bagels until 
                golden brown. Alternatively, you can use a pop-up 
                toaster. In that case, wait to butter the bagel after 
                it's toasted.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and, 
                once melted, crack both eggs into pan. As soon as the 
                whites start to set, puncture the yolks and gently 
                spread them over the whites. Season with salt and pepper.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Layer the cheese and the becon on top of one of the eggs 
                and, using a spatula, flip the other egg on top of the 
                becon. Cook for a few extra seconds for the cheese to melt.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Once the cheese has melted, transfer the eggs to the 
                bagel bottom and top with the bagel top.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve immediately or wrap for a on-the-go breakfast!</p></li>
